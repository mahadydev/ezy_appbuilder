First , lets go through all the files and folders to get full context of the project. read all the docs as well. Now, in the appbuilder feature, when we drag and drop a widget , it goes to the children or child of parent widget. but what if i want to add a child inside another widget. for example: we add a scaffold, appbar, then a stack. inside stack we want to add an image for background, on top of it we want position and inside that position widget we want to add different child. so what i am trying to accomplish is to specifically drag a widget on to another widget properly (nested) just like flutterflow. just give me the logics to do it based on the project.
